# search, search and replace

Don't use *search and replace* to describe finding and replacing things in a document or other location. Use *find* and *replace* instead.

Use *search* and *replace* as verbs, not as nouns or adjectives.

**Example**  
Search your document. 

**See also** [find and replace](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/f/find-replace.md)
