# SQL, SQL Server

When you're referring to a computer that's running Microsoft SQL Server, use *a computer running SQL Server* or *a computer that's running SQL Server*. (Note the capital *S* in *Server*.)

Never refer to a computer that's running Microsoft SQL Server as any of the following:

  - the SQL Server
  - a SQL Server
  - SQL Servers
  - SQL server

When you're referring to Structured Query Language as *SQL,* use the indefinite article *an:* *an* *SQL database.*
