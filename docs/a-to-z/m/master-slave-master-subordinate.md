# master/slave, master/subordinate

Don't use *master/slave.* 
In content for a technical audience, it's OK to substitute *subordinate* for *slave.* 

Use *master/subordinate* as an adjective. Refer to arrangements in which one device controls another as a *master/subordinate arrangement,* or refer to the controlling device as the *master server* and the controlled device as the *subordinate server.* 

When you need to clarify the concept, it's OK to reference the use of *slave* as an adjective by saying *also known as the slave server.* It's OK to use *master server* and *slave server* as synonyms in keyword lists.

Avoid using *slave* as an adjective. Never use *slave* as a noun.

Don't use *master/subordinate* as a synonym for *parent/child.* 

**Examples**<br />Each subordinate device has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address. <br />The architecture uses a standard master/subordinate design to replicate data from one server to many.
