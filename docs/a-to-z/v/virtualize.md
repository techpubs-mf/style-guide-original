# virtualize

Don't use in content for a general audience.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *virtualize* sparingly to mean creating a virtual implementation. For example, it's OK to use *virtualize storage* to refer to creating virtual storage. 

Don't use as a synonym for *simulate*.
